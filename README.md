# PyMol_SphericalHarmonics
This repository containts the Plugin 'spherical_harmonics.py' for PyMol (tested on version 2.5.0 Open-Source).
This adds the functionality of plotting spherical harmonics functions on any atom of a molecule loaded in PyMol.
The functionality is extremely helpful for visualising ***Atomic Orbitals**** or ***Spherical Multipole Moments***.
